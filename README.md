## Usage

You can change the `ruleset` variable in `src/main.c`, and set a rule based on [wolfram's 256 rules](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html). You may also change the `CELL_SIZE` in `include/automata.h` to change the size of each pixel.

## Dependencies

- `SDL2`
- May need to change `CMakeLists.txt` depending on your system, unless I update it for all OS's

## Compile & Run

```bash
./compile ; ./run
```
